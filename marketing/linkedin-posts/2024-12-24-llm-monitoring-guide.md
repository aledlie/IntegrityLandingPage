I spent 40 hours testing 11 LLM observability platforms so you don't have to—and honestly, most of them made me want to flip a table.

The problem? Most "monitoring" tools are just glorified uptime checkers. They'll tell you your API is alive, but good luck understanding why your multi-step agent just hallucinated a nonexistent customer record or why your November bill jumped 300%.

Here's what actually matters in 2025:

→ Multi-step agent tracing (not just "API go brrr")
→ Cost attribution that shows you WHICH feature is burning money
→ Hallucination detection that doesn't add 500ms of latency
→ EU AI Act compliance readiness (August 2025 deadline = 7% revenue penalty if you screw up)

Quick wins from my testing:
• Helicone: 2-minute setup, literally just change your API base URL
• Phoenix: Free forever, self-hosted, 8k GitHub stars for a reason
• Langfuse: Prompt versioning that actually prevents "wait, which version are we running in prod?"
• Fiddler: Sub-100ms guardrails for compliance-obsessed teams

The kicker? Apple acquired WhyLabs in January, which tells you everything about where this market is headed ($1.97B → $8B by 2034).

Pro tip: Monitor output tokens obsessively. They cost 3-5x more than input tokens, and most teams are hemorrhaging money because they're not tracking them.

Full breakdown with pricing, compliance checklists, and "which tool for your nightmare scenario" guide:
