      '${CompanyInfo.name} was founded with a clear purpose: to solve the visibility problem '
      'in production AI systems. As LLMs and AI agents became critical to business operations, '
      'we saw teams struggling with black-box AI decisions, unpredictable costs, and looming '
      'regulatory requirements like the EU AI Act.\n\n'
      'Our founders built observability tools at scale before, and recognized that AI systems '
      'needed purpose-built monitoring—not retrofitted APM solutions. We designed ${CompanyInfo.name} '
      'from the ground up for the unique challenges of LLM applications: token-level cost attribution, '
      'multi-step agent tracing, and compliance documentation that satisfies auditors.\n\n'
      'Today, we help AI teams ship reliable, compliant applications faster. Our platform provides '
      'the visibility they need to debug issues, optimize costs, and demonstrate governance to '
      'stakeholders—all from a single pane of glass.';
