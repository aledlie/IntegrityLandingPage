  title: "About Integrity Studio"
  subtitle: "Building Trust in AI Systems"

  mission_statement: >-
    Empower enterprises to build trustworthy AI systems through comprehensive
    observability and governance tools.

  vision_statement: >-
    To be the standard for enterprise AI observability, enabling organizations
    to deploy AI confidently while meeting regulatory requirements.

  story: >-
    Integrity Studio was founded with a clear purpose: to solve the visibility problem
    in production AI systems. As LLMs and AI agents became critical to business operations,
    we saw teams struggling with black-box AI decisions, unpredictable costs, and looming
    regulatory requirements like the EU AI Act.


    Our founders built observability tools at scale before, and recognized that AI systems
    needed purpose-built monitoring—not retrofitted APM solutions. We designed Integrity Studio
    from the ground up for the unique challenges of LLM applications: token-level cost attribution,
    multi-step agent tracing, and compliance documentation that satisfies auditors.


    Today, we help AI teams ship reliable, compliant applications faster. Our platform provides
    the visibility they need to debug issues, optimize costs, and demonstrate governance to
    stakeholders—all from a single pane of glass.

  values:
    - icon: "eye"
      title: "Transparency"
      description: >-
        We believe AI systems should be observable and explainable. Every decision,
        every cost, every outcome should be visible to the teams responsible for them.

    - icon: "shield-check"
      title: "Trust"
      description: >-
        Trust is earned through reliability, security, and accountability. We build tools
        that help our customers demonstrate trustworthiness to their users and regulators.

      title: "Developer-First"
      description: >-
        Great tools should get out of the developer's way. We prioritize clean APIs,
        fast integration, and minimal overhead so teams can focus on building.

      title: "Compliance by Design"

        Regulatory requirements shouldn't be an afterthought. We embed compliance
